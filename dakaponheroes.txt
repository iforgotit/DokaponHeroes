Add players
players can move 1 square per turn
If at the end of the turn two players are at the same square next turn is a battle
Rock, paper, scissors to start? Dokapon style
Last player alive wins

Who goes first? Highest cunning then coin flip
During a battle you pick two actions - Offensive and defensive

Offensive Actions:
Powerful Attack - 3*[might]
Defensive Attack - 1*[might]
Magic Missile - 2*[magic]
Retreat - No action at the end of turn teleported to a new square

Defensive Action:
Counter Attack - Take full damage unless Powerful Attack on powerful attack, attacker takes 2*[might]
Block - Reduce damage by 1/2
Resist - Magic damage - defenders[magic]
Focus - Increase all stats by [magic] for 2 turns

Dodge% = ((Defenders [cunning] + 1) - Attackers [cunning])*5
